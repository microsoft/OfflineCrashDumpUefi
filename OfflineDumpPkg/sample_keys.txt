sample_keys.cer contains a sample self-signed certificate (public key).

sample_keys.pfx contains the corresponding private key (password abc123).

dumpvars.nsh will install the sample certificate and will configure the system
to generate encrypted dumps using that certificate. The resulting dumps can
be decrypted using the sample_keys.pfx private key.
